Work on writing code with solid design principles in mind
practice git branching
practice webpack 
work on problem solving skill

what you have to consider to solve the problem
Is the clicked element a king or regular piece
Is the default possible move occupied or not
   If it is, is the next possible move occupied



Game logic pseudo code
Movements
FOR PLAYER ONE
when a player clicks on a piece
determine the possible moves and highlight them
 get the equivalent piece from the array
 store it into a variable
 go into the prev row depending on the player playing
 IF the row of the stored piece is odd
  IF the stored piece is the first in its row
   possibleMove = the first square of the previous row
  ELSE possibleMove = equivalent index of the stored piece - 1 and equivalent index of the stored piece in the the prev row
 ELSE IF the row of the stored piece is even
  IF the stored piece is the first in its row
   possibleMoves = equivalent index of the stored piece and equivalent index of the stored piece + 1 in the the prev row
when a player clicks on a possible move
move the piece clicked from its current position to the possible move clicked
